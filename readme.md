# Pitchfork Data

I scraped over 5000 [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/) reviews, going back to September 30, 2011. This repository will contain my analyses!

## Some things i want to know:

- Are best new music reviews IID over time? what about scores?
- Which genres are most related to other genres? (i.e., more so than you'd assume by random association)
- What length of time is required for a re-release? (i.e., what is avg. time between review and orig. release date).


### Later, if I scrape data going back to the early 2000s

- Can re-releases (i.e., candidates for re-release) be predicted based on review content?
