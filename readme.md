# Pitchfork Data

I scraped over 18000 [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/) reviews, going back to January 1999. This repository will contain my analyses!

## Some things i want to know:

- Are best new music reviews IID over time? what about scores?
- Are best new music reviews longer? shorter?
- Do individual reviewers get 'tougher' over time? Or easier?
- How do artists perform over multiple releases? Is the first album usually the best?
- What is avg. amount of time between review and orig. release date?
- Can candidates for re-release be predicted based on first-round review content? Can you predict when an album should be re-released based on current data?
