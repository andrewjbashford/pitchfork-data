# Pitchfork Data

I scraped over 18000 [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/) reviews, going back to January 1999. This repository will contain my analyses!

## Notebooks:

- [[Link](notebooks/review-score-exploration.ipynb)]. An exploration of review scores.
- [[Link](notebooks/reviewer-development.ipynb)]. Do writers get tougher with experience? (answer: *no*.)


## Some things i want to know:

- Are best new music reviews IID over time? what about scores?
- Are best new music reviews longer? shorter?
- How do artists perform over multiple releases? Is the first album usually the best?
- What is avg. amount of time between reissue and orig. release date?
- Can candidates for re-release be predicted based on first-round review content? Can you predict when an album should be re-released based on current data?
